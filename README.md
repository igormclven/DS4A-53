Rionegroâ€™s Town (one of Antioquia's department municipalities) recognizes and suffers from the fact  that sources of public resources are limited and the social needs tend to increase over time. Therefore, one of their aims is to predict incomes and then use this information to optimize the short and long term expenditure & investment planning and execution processes and thus solve the problem of planning and making investments without knowing what the actual income will be. An important source of this income is real estate. Project scope is limited to predict this specific income

This is the link to the EDA folder in which we have all the jupyter notebooks corresponding to each EDA developed -> [EDA Folder](./EDA)

# 2. External Data

These are the links refrerring to the pages where we extract external data for building our model:
 - TRM rate -> [TRM](https://www.banrep.gov.co/es/estadisticas/trm)
 - Nominal IPVU Medellin -> [IPVU](https://www.banrep.gov.co/es/estadisticas/indice-precios-vivienda-usada-ipvu)
 - Seven Colombian metropolitan areas Occupancy rate -> [Occupancy rate](https://www.banrep.gov.co/es/estadisticas/tasas-ocupacion-y-desempleo)

# 3. How the model was built?

 </p>

 Here you can find four R scripts: three time series for predicting TRM rate, nominal IPVU Medellin and seven Colombian metropolitan areas Occupancy rate and a final R script for the modeling; and the model is located in the python file.In addition we have a python script including a k-means for a future version of the application.
 
  - Python model -> [Python file model](./Model/Model.py)
  - K-means model -> [Jupyter Notebook K-means](./Model/Cluster%20predial.ipynb)
  - Time Series for TRM rate ->  [R script TRM rate](./Model/Cluster%20predial.ipynb)
  - Time Series for Nominal IPVU Medellin -> [R script IPVU Medellin](./Model/Cluster%20predial.ipynb)
  - Time Series for Occupancy Rate -> [R script Occupancy rate](./Model/Cluster%20predial.ipynb)
